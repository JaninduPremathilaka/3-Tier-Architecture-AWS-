**Discover the power of 3-Tier Architecture on AWS!**  
This project demonstrates a secure, scalable, and highly available 3-tier architecture deployed on Amazon Web Services (AWS). It separates the presentation, application, and database layers—improving manageability, performance, and security. Developed as part of my final year studies at **London Metropolitan University**.
